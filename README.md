# More Than Grammar

This is the version of my teaching website using Python/Flask that I created in my first cycle at Frauenloop.

## Running the app on your system

Before you start, please create a virual environment in the project folder and activate it (example iOS):
```
# create virutal environment

$ python3 -m venv env

# activate virutal env
$ source env/bin/activate
```
You can also follow the instructions given in the [Flask docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/installation/?highlight=virtual)


In order to install all nececsary libraries please run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

Now run the app by using following command:
```
$ python run.py
```
